Selected analyses I performed for the study "Single-nuclei gene-expression analysis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma links disease subtypes with tumor microenvironment" in collaboration with the University of Melbourne Centre for Cancer Research Rare Disease Oncogenomics Laboratory. See the [Nature Communications article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34011-3) and the [main project repository](https://github.com/UMCCR-RADIO-Lab/snRNA-seq-atlas-of-pheochromocytoma-and-paraganglioma).
